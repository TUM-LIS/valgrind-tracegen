==================

Commits on the trunk that should be considered for merging to 3.10.1
(write here :-)

(mjw comments from 30 Sept 2014)

  there are some mips fixes that might be interesting, but I don't
  have a mips setup atm.

  There were patches for the PTRACE_GETSIGINFO issue, which would be
  nice to get thing to build out of the box on some older setups

  silly, but ugly: Add missing ]] to terminate CDATA. (r14561).

  r14559 maybe (Fix wrong checking of ARG2 of getrlimit).

  Nice to have (but ask Philippe) #339156/r14556. 

  Maybe r14549 (DRD/arm, ask Bart?). 

  ppc/ stfdpx #339020/r14545

  The lxvw4x would be nice, but I think the fix is not correct yet
  (see endian issue I reported today)

  Bug 339182 Vex r2960

  Bug 339336 Vex r2957

  Check Vex r2953 (are those real bugs or just cleanup?)

  (consider): backwards-compatibility-special-sequence-on-ppc32
