A typical "make" will not build documentation.
Documentation is only built during "make dist".
Typically, building documentation will fail.

On Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS the following is known to work:

Required packages:
texlive
dblatex
xsltproc
xmltex
docbook-xml
docbook-xsl

Additional the following lines need to be changed in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/oberdiek/epstopdf-base.sty
around line 450  from


\ifETE@prepend
  \expandafter\PrependGraphicsExtensions
\else
  \expandafter\AppendGraphicsExtensions
\fi
{.eps}


to


%% \ifETE@prepend
%%   \expandafter\PrependGraphicsExtensions
%% \else
%%   \expandafter\AppendGraphicsExtensions
%% \fi
%% {.eps}


This hack was devised by Mark Wielaard. 

It is unknown how to build documentation on other platforms.
